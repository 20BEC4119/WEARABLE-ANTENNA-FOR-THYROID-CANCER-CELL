## Innovative Z-Shape Wearable Patch Antenna for Biomedical Applications Over Textile Substrates

### Abstract

This project introduces an innovative Z-shape wearable patch antenna designed to be implemented over textile and other types of substrates for testing its performance over the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) band of microwave frequencies. The wearable antenna possesses textile-like properties and is capable of bending in 2D, making it flexible for wearable electronic devices. Due to its operation on the ISM band, the antenna is well-suited for biomedical applications. The implementation of a silk substrate is chosen for its low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), making it suitable for detecting cancer cells when placed on the thyroid gland. The antenna's performance was evaluated when placed on the thyroid gland, considering tissue properties within and without cancer-affected areas. Since cancer cells have higher water content, changes in gain and electrical conductivity were observed. Additionally, the working frequency of the Z-patch silk substrate wearable antenna showed variations when placed on the thyroid gland. Simulated and measured results have been tabulated, and the antenna's S11 results have been demonstrated using a network analyzer.

### Introduction

Wearable electronics have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their convenience and versatility. In this context, the development of a Z-shape wearable patch antenna over textile substrates opens up exciting possibilities for various applications, including biomedical scenarios. This document discusses the antenna's design, its properties, and its performance analysis over the ISM band, with a specific focus on detecting cancer cells when placed on the thyroid gland.

### Materials and Methods

The Z-shape wearable patch antenna is designed to be implemented over silk substrates due to its low SAR characteristics. The antenna's textile-like properties make it suitable for wearable electronic devices, providing flexibility and comfort to users. To evaluate its performance, the antenna is placed on the thyroid gland to detect cancer cells. Tissue properties, including dielectric constant and water content, are considered and analyzed within and without cancer-affected areas. Simulated and measured results are obtained and compared to assess the antenna's efficacy.

### Results

The fabricated Z-shape wearable patch antenna shows promising results in terms of gain, electrical conductivity, and working frequency. When placed on the thyroid gland, changes in these parameters are observed due to the varying tissue properties, especially the increased water content in cancer-affected areas. The S11 results of the antenna are analyzed using a network analyzer, demonstrating its effectiveness in the desired frequency range.

### Discussion

The proposed Z-shape wearable patch antenna proves to be an innovative solution for biomedical applications, especially in detecting cancer cells on the thyroid gland. The use of silk substrate ensures low SAR, making it safe for medical purposes. However, further studies may be required to investigate other substrate options and their performance characteristics for different biomedical applications.

### Conclusion

The Z-shape wearable patch antenna designed over textile substrates has shown promising results for biomedical applications, specifically for cancer detection on the thyroid gland. Its flexibility, combined with the use of soft substrate materials like silk, makes it suitable for wearable electronic devices with minimized health risks. The antenna's performance over the ISM band provides reliable wireless communication for various biomedical monitoring and diagnostic applications.
